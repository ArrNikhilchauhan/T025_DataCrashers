🌊 JalNetra — AI-Powered Groundwater Intelligence Platform
🔎 Predict. Prioritise. Preserve.

JalNetra is an intelligent RAG-based platform that predicts groundwater depletion trends, identifies recharge priorities, and delivers actionable recommendations for farmers, agritech companies, and government agencies — all from a single unified system.

Our mission is simple: make groundwater visible, predictable, and manageable using the power of AI, geospatial data, and reasoning engines.

🚜 Problem Statement

India faces a critical groundwater crisis — with over 60% of agriculture dependent on it, yet water tables are dropping at alarming rates.
Today’s challenges include:

🌾 Farmers lack real-time insights on how much water is available before crop planning.

🛰️ Governments invest in recharge projects without precise prioritization.

💼 Agritech companies struggle to identify profitable, high-impact recharge zones.

JalNetra bridges this gap with data-driven intelligence and localized recommendations.

💡 What JalNetra Does

🔍 For Farmers:

Predict whether they will need high irrigation investment before the cropping season.

Recommend suitable crops based on water availability and soil profile.

Deliver personalized advisories in regional languages via text or voice.

🏢 For Agritech Companies:

Identify where recharge structures will have maximum impact.

Reduce scouting from 10+ potential sites to the most impactful 4–5.

Predict recharge potential after rainfall events.

🏛️ For Government Agencies:

Provide AI-backed reports on depletion zones and recharge priorities.

Integrate with existing CGWB, IMD, and ISRO data to improve planning accuracy.

Help allocate budget and tenders where they matter most.

🧠 How It Works (RAG Flow)

Data Ingestion: Collects groundwater CSVs, rainfall patterns, soil data, and satellite imagery.

Preprocessing & Indexing: Cleans, normalizes, and stores them in a vector database (FAISS/Chroma).

Retrieval: Semantic search retrieves the most relevant hydrological and geographic documents.

LLM Reasoning: A Large Language Model (LLM) analyzes the retrieved context to generate insights and structured recommendations.

Delivery: Personalized output (text, charts, or voice) is provided via web dashboard or API.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Backend: FastAPI / Python

Frontend: React.js + Leaflet.js (Geospatial UI)

AI Layer: LangChain, FAISS, OpenAI / Gemini APIs

Database: PostgreSQL / TimescaleDB

Deployment: Docker + CI/CD

Other: Pandas, GeoPandas, Shapely, PostGIS
